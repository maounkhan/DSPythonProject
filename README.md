# Python Project for Data Science
This was a GitHub repository created for the final assignment of IBM's *Python Project for Data Science* assignment. The purpose of this was to demonstrate an understanding of webscraping and extracting data from the web using various Python libraries and APIs, as well as data visualization and creating a dashboard. This was done using the Jupyter Notebook platform.

Note: The preview does not seem to show either graph. To see them, you can either download the notebook and run the code yourself or simply view the screenshots for Questions 5 and 6.
